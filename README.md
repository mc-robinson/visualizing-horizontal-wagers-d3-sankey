# Pick 4 Sankey Diagram with End-to-End Highlighting

------------------------

This diagram is a proof-of-concept to demonstrate how inefficient horizontal exotic horse racing wagers may be identified visually. The thickness of ribbons (links) represents the number of combinations that include the particular selection. 

- Move the mouse over nodes or links. The specific portion will be highlighted from end to end.
- Double click on the diagram to toggle rich tooltips.
- Drag the rectangular nodes to move them.

This visualization was developed by [Robin Howlett](http://www.robinhowlett.com), forked from [Ming Qin's d3-sankey-with-highlighting](//github.com/QinMing/d3-sankey-with-highlighting) repository, which in turn is based on the [D3 Sankey plugin](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/sankey/) written by [Mike Bostock](//github.com/mbostock) (<mike@ocks.org>).

A live demo of Ming Qin's original implementation, using the survival statistics of the Titanic disaster, is available at [QinMing.github.io/sankey](http://qinming.github.io/d3-sankey-with-highlighting/).
